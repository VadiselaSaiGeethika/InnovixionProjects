    "\n",
    "As we all know, nowadays wake up on time is a very difficult task. The solution is the Alarm Clock. In this article, we will learn, How to create an Alarm Clock using Tkinter in Python. Without alarms, several people would oversleep and land up late for work. Alarm clocks may also be useful for keeping sleep schedules regular.\n",

    "Tkinter: Python offers multiple choices for developing a GUI (Graphical User Interface). Out of all the GUI strategies, tkinter is that the most ordinarily used technique. It’s a customary Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python.\n",

    "Winsound: The winsound module provides access to the essential sound-playing machinery provided by Windows platforms. It includes functions and a number of other constants. Beep the PC’s speaker.\n",
